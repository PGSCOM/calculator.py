# Any Isue?
Create an Issue [here](https://github.com/PGSCOM/calculator.py/issues/new)

# It is not in my language. Can I translate it?
Of course, you just have to create a Fork, make a copy naming it with the language you translate 'calculatorES.py' and that's it.

You can also translate the README by doing the same and putting it in the 'Other README' folder
